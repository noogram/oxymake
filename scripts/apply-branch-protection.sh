# "A CI job not in required_status_checks
# lets the operator merge red — it is theater." This script is the one act that
# converts every CI radar into an exogenous GATE. It is UNRUNNABLE while the repo
# is private (branch protection → HTTP 403 without Pro); run it IMMEDIATELY after
# the public flip, in the fixed sequence: clean → flip → PROTECT → enforce.
#
# It is idempotent: re-running re-asserts the same protection.
